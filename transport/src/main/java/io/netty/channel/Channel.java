/**
 * A nexus to a network socket or a component which is capable of I/O
 * operations such as read, write, connect, and bind.
 * <p>
 * A channel provides a user:
 * <ul>
 * <li>the current state of the channel (e.g. is it open? is it connected?),</li>
 * <li>the {@linkplain ChannelConfig configuration parameters} of the channel (e.g. receive buffer size),</li>
 * <li>the I/O operations that the channel supports (e.g. read, write, connect, and bind), and</li>
 * <li>the {@link ChannelPipeline} which handles all I/O events and requests
 *     associated with the channel.</li>
 * </ul>
 *
 * <h3>All I/O operations are asynchronous.</h3>
 * <p>
 * All I/O operations in Netty are asynchronous.  It means any I/O calls will
 * return immediately with no guarantee that the requested I/O operation has
 * been completed at the end of the call.  Instead, you will be returned with
 * a {@link ChannelFuture} instance which will notify you when the requested I/O
 * operation has succeeded, failed, or canceled.
 *
 * <h3>Channels are hierarchical</h3>
 * <p>
 * A {@link Channel} can have a {@linkplain #parent() parent} depending on
 * how it was created.  For instance, a {@link SocketChannel}, that was accepted
 * by {@link ServerSocketChannel}, will return the {@link ServerSocketChannel}
 * as its parent on {@link #parent()}.
 * <p>
 * The semantics of the hierarchical structure depends on the transport
 * implementation where the {@link Channel} belongs to.  For example, you could
 * write a new {@link Channel} implementation that creates the sub-channels that
 * share one socket connection, as <a href="http://beepcore.org/">BEEP</a> and
 * <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Secure_Shell">SSH</a> do.
 *
 * <h3>Downcast to access transport-specific operations</h3>
 * <p>
 * Some transports exposes additional operations that is specific to the
 * transport.  Down-cast the {@link Channel} to sub-type to invoke such
 * operations.  For example, with the old I/O datagram transport, multicast
 * join / leave operations are provided by {@link DatagramChannel}.
 *
 * <h3>Release resources</h3>
 * <p>
 * It is important to call {@link #close()} or {@link #close(ChannelPromise)} to release all
 * resources once you are done with the {@link Channel}. This ensures all resources are
 * released in a proper way, i.e. filehandles.
 *
 *  为什么 Netty 不使用原生的 java.nio.channel :
 *      1. SocketChannel 和 ServerSocketChannel 没有统一的 Channel 接口供业务开发这使用，对于用户而言，没有统一的操作视图，使用不方便
 *      2. SocketChannel 和 ServerSocketChannel 的主要职责就是网络IO, 由于它们是SPI接口，由具体的虚拟机厂家提供，所以通过继承 SPI 功能类
 *      扩展功能的嫩度很大， 直接实现这两个抽象类，其工作量和开发一个新的 channel 功能类差不多。
 *      3. Netty 的 channel 能与 Netty 的整体架构融合再一起，例如 IO模型、基于 ChannelPiple 的定制模型、以及基于元数据描述配置化的TCP参数等，
 *      这些 JDK 的 Channel 都没有提供， 需要重新封装。
 *      4. 自定义的 Channel 功能更灵活。
 *
 *   Netty Channel 接口的设计理念
 *      1. 在 Channel 接口层，采用外观模式进行统一封装， 将网络IO操作、网络IO相关的其他操作封装起来，同一对外提供。
 *      2. Channel 接口的定义尽量大而全，为  SocketChannel 和 ServerSocketChannel  提供了统一的视图，由不同的子类实现不同的功能，公共功能
 *      在父类中提供，最大程度的实现了功能和接口的重用。
 *      3. 采用聚合而非包含的方式，将相关的功能类聚合在Channel 中，由 Channel 负责统一分配和调度，功能实现更加灵活。
